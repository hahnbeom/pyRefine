PoseInfo.py: Contains all "Static" info about pose
TERM.py: Contains all "Static" info about TERM definitions

Matcher.py:
*class MatchSolution
- Given PoseInfo 

*class Matcher
Logic:
0. Get SSinfo from PoseInfo...
 - pyRefine reads pose and builds PoseInfo given "SS definitions"
 - SSdef == Jump def 

1. Get list of Anchor(s) & "ULR"
 - Anchor could be 1 or 2 SSclass
 - Find registers if is 2-SS-anchor
 - ULR should be 1 SSclass

2. Define Anchor-ULR match as MatchSolution
 - find possible list of Threads: MatchSolution has multiple threads
 - either seq-only OR estogram
 
3. Matcher searches consistent TERM indices for given MatchSolutions
 - dump 
 - dump in some npz form of coordinates?
